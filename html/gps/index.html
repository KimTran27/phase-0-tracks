<!-- What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? HTML 5 improves readability and the semantic allows data to be shared across all applications. The semantic elements clearly describe its meaning to both the browser and the developer. Back then, non-semantic tags like <div> and <span> tells nothing about its content. Now, with semantic elements, we can clearly identify the content. Like forum post, newspaper article, would go under the <article> tag. Major block of navigation links would go under <nav> tag.

Which ones do you see as most useful?
They're all important and you should use semantic tags in the right way. Like put section tag inside aritcle tag, not vice versa. I've been using <header><nav><footer> a lot more often to create better semantic structure to my content.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
The browser would read Html from top to bottom.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I learn about snippets in sublime, my pair and I created a code snippet for sublime text. I will use snippet again for creating tables and forms, since those usually take awhile to set up, and having a snippet already done would come in handy.


What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept? 
So far, I have a decent and better understanding of HTML. Something I could improve on would knowing what the purpose of each semantic tag was, and where it belongs, in terms of order on the page. I still have to look up on my notes to verify, but I think with practice I will become more efficient in HTML and CSS.-->
