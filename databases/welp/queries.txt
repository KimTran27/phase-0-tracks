In the welp directory, create a file called queries.txt. Once you've figured out the queries below, paste them into queries.txt, along with the output from your database.

CREATE TABLE businesses (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(255)
);
CREATE TABLE users (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
first_name VARCHAR(255),
last_name VARCHAR(255)
);
CREATE TABLE businesses_users (
business_id INT,
user_id INT,
FOREIGN KEY (business_id) REFERENCES businesses(id) 
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
CREATE TABLE reviews (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
stars INT,
comment VARCHAR(255),
business_id INT,
user_id INT,
FOREIGN KEY (business_id) REFERENCES businesses(id)
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);

You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?
SELECT * FROM businesses, reviews, users WHERE reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND reviews.user_id = users.id;

1|veggie town|1|5|great food!|1|1|1|kim|tran
1|veggie town|2|4|yummy food!|1|2|2|kimberly|transcendent
2|veggie ville|3|5|highly recommend!!|2|2|2|kimberly|transcendent
2|veggie ville|4|2|took way too long to get your order!|2|3|3|kimmy|tee


There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

SELECT users.First_name, users.Last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM businesses JOIN users JOIN reviews ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND reviews.user_id = users.id;
kim|tran|veggie town|5|great food!
kimberly|transcendent|veggie town|4|yummy food!
kimberly|transcendent|veggie ville|5|highly recommend!!
kimmy|tee|veggie ville|2|took way too long to get your order!

How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

SELECT * FROM businesses, reviews, users WHERE reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND reviews.user_id = users.id AND businesses.id=1;
1|veggie town|1|5|great food!|1|1|1|kim|tran
1|veggie town|2|4|yummy food!|1|2|2|kimberly|transcendent
