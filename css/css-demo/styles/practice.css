/* When there is a conflict between two CSS rules that select the same element, 
how does your browser decide which rule to use?
If two selectors apply to the same element, the one with higher specificity wins.
There are four distinct categories which define the specificity level of a given selector: 
inline styles, IDs, classes+attributes and elements.
Cascading Order and Inheritance in CSS. CSS styles can be specified in many ways, 
but they will all cascade into one style sheet in the end. Sometimes conflicts 
will arise between the style sheets that influence how styles are merged.
If some properties have been defined for the same selector (element) in different 
style sheets, the value from the last read style sheet will be used. 
A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element. 
For example, it can be used to: Style an element when a user mouses over it.
The syntax of pseudo-elements: 
selector::pseudo-element { 
	property:value; 
}
p::first-line {
    color: #ff0000;
    font-variant: small-caps;
}
